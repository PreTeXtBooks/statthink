        <title>Preface</title>
        
        <p>
          The target audience for this book is college students who are required
          to learn statistics, students with little background in mathematics and
          often no motivation to learn more. It is assumed that the students do
          have basic skills in using computers and have access to one. Moreover,
          it is assumed that the students are willing to actively follow the
          discussion in the text, to practice, and more importantly, to think.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teaching statistics is a challenge. Teaching it to students who are
          required to learn the subject as part of their curriculum, is an art
          mastered by few. In the past I have tried to master this art and failed.
          In desperation, I wrote this book.
        </p>

        <p>
          This book uses the basic structure of generic introduction to statistics
          course. However, in some ways I have chosen to diverge from the
          traditional approach. One divergence is the introduction of <c>R</c> as part
          of the learning process. Many have used statistical packages or
          spreadsheets as tools for teaching statistics. Others have used <c>R</c> in
          advanced courses. I am not aware of attempts to use <c>R</c> in introductory
          level courses. Indeed, mastering <c>R</c> requires much investment of time
          and energy that may be distracting and counterproductive for learning
          more fundamental issues. Yet, I believe that if one restricts the
          application of <c>R</c> to a limited number of commands, the benefits that
          <c>R</c> provides outweigh the difficulties that <c>R</c> engenders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another departure from the standard approach is the treatment of
          probability as part of the course. In this book I do not attempt to
          teach probability as a subject matter, but only specific elements of it
          which I feel are essential for understanding statistics. Hence,
          Kolmogorov's Axioms are out as well as attempts to prove basic theorems
          and a Balls and Urns type of discussion. On the other hand, emphasis is
          given to the notion of a <term>random variable</term> and, in that context, the
          <term>sample space</term>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first part of the book deals with descriptive statistics and
          provides probability concepts that are required for the interpretation
          of statistical inference. Statistical inference is the subject of the
          second part of the book.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first chapter is a short introduction to statistics and probability.
          Students are required to have access to <c>R</c> right from the start.
          Instructions regarding the installation of <c>R</c> on a PC are provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second chapter deals with data structures and variation. Chapter 3
          provides numerical and graphical tools for presenting and summarizing
          the distribution of data.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fundamentals of probability are treated in Chapters 4 to 7. The
          concept of a random variable is presented in Chapter 4 and examples of
          special types of random variables are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6
          deals with the Normal random variable. Chapter 7 introduces sampling
          distribution and presents the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large
          Numbers. Chapter 8 summarizes the material of the first seven chapters
          and discusses it in the statistical context.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chapter 9 starts the second part of the book and the discussion of
          statistical inference. It provides an overview of the topics that are
          presented in the subsequent chapter. The material of the first half is
          revisited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chapters 10 to 12 introduce the basic tools of statistical inference,
          namely point estimation, estimation with a confidence interval, and the
          testing of statistical hypothesis. All these concepts are demonstrated
          in the context of a single measurements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chapters 13 to 15 discuss inference that involve the comparison of two
          measurements. The context where these comparisons are carried out is
          that of regression that relates the distribution of a response to an
          explanatory variable. In Chapter 13 the response is numeric and the
          explanatory variable is a factor with two levels. In Chapter 14 both the
          response and the explanatory variable are numeric and in Chapter 15 the
          response in a factor with two levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chapter 16 ends the book with the analysis of two case studies. These
          analyses require the application of the tools that are presented
          throughout the book.
        </p>

        <p>
          This book was originally written for a pair of courses in the
          University of the People. As such, each part
          was restricted to 8 chapters. Due to lack of space, some important
          material, especially the concepts of correlation and statistical
          independence were omitted. In future versions of the book I hope to fill
          this gap.
        </p>

        <p>
          Large portions of this book, mainly in the first chapters and some of
          the quizzes, are based on material from the online book <q>Collaborative
          Statistics</q> by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean. Most of the material was
          edited by this author, who is the only person responsible for any errors
          that where introduced in the process of editing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Case studies that are presented in the second part of the book are taken
          from Rice Virtual Lab in Statistics.
          The responsibility for mistakes in the analysis of the data, if such
          mistakes are found, are my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would like to thank my mother Ruth who, apart from giving birth,
          feeding and educating me, has also helped to improve the pedagogical
          structure of this text. I would like to thank also Gary Engstrom for
          correcting many of the mistakes in English that I made.
